                    <p class="about-content">
                        With the summer holiday season approaching, airlines are becoming understandably nervous about the UK’s traffic light system.  The impact of this system on the number of customers travelling abroad during the busiest period of the year can be significant for the finances of these companies. <br><br>
                        Given that many British people tend to holiday in Europe, currently most of the continent is on the orange list and so all returning travellers from these countries must quarantine at home for ten days. If not followed, travellers can face a hefty fine and so many avoid travelling abroad. As a result, this can quickly lead to empty seats on airplanes. A lot of empty seats. <br><br>
                        And so, moving up more countries to the UK’s green list would be a dream come true for the aviation industry. However, while the government is under pressure to do exactly this, another perspective must be looked at altogether. <br><br>
                        Many in Europe are not so keen to open their borders to non-essential travel from the UK. The reason being the more transmissible Delta variant has cemented its position as the UK’s dominant Covid strain. For example, if the UK classified Germany as a green category country tomorrow, Germany would be hard-pressed to do the same otherwise risk a surge in the Delta variant. <br><br>
                        Encouragingly, there are on-going discussions in Downing Street of allowing fully vaccinated people face less restrictions when travelling abroad and removing quarantining on their return. This could be a life-line for the aviation industry across Europe in getting people sat in their airplanes and rebooting global tourism. <br><br>
                        But the delicate question is whether it is fair that every adult should have the opportunity to be fully vaccinated before this proposal gets the green light and departs from the runway.

                    <p class="about-content">
                        Recently, the UK government announced all those aged 18+ can book their covid vaccination jab from the NHS. This is good news considering the rapid spread of the Delta variant across the UK, and in particular the younger adult population. <br><br>
                        Encouragingly, it has been reported that while two doses provide better protection against Covid-19, one dose significantly reduces the risk of severe disease and hospitalisation. The more jabs in arms, the smaller the risk of hospitals being over-run and thus the more likely social restrictions can be relaxed. <br><br>
                        The date for the further unlocking of society in the UK is the 19th of July, the so-called ‘Freedom Day’ and it looks promising that there will not be another delay. The key reason being that whilst cases are rising, hospitalisation and subsequent deaths from Covid-19 are not rising as fast as the first or second wave. This is positive news considering how much more transmissible the Delta variant is compared to the Alpha variant. <br><br>
                        Another matter that ministers in Westminster will be contemplating is whether school children should be next to be vaccinated or if these doses should instead be diverted to countries urgently in need to fully vaccinate their front line healthcare workers and elderly population. <br><br>
                        But right now it is a race against time to get the younger adult population vaccinated with one and then two doses.

                            My first real-world use of Python was performing data analysis and visualisation of my monthly spending during the first year of my PhD. In particular, I used Pandas – a tool I find personally to be more powerful than Excel!<br><br>
                            I started by exporting twelve months of financial data available from my bank and adding sub-tags to each transaction before importing the modified data into Pandas. By using Python and Pandas together, I created a function with a few lines of code which could manipulate the data in a specific way. <br><br>
                            This function could search for a pre-defined sub-tag through the many hundreds of transactions and sum up the total per month to produce a simpler table of data. For example, it could instantly tabulate the monthly spend at Sainsburys (a supermarket in the UK) from a years’ worth of financial transactions. With this table in hand, I was then able to visualise this data as a bar chart by using another Python tool called Matplotlib. <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <div class="structure-list">

                            Inquisitive about exploiting Matplotlib further, I was then able to generate a stacked bar chart of the spend of all supermarkets I visited per month. This provided me with a more in-depth visualisation of my monthly grocery spend.  <br><br>

                            The use of data analysis tools in this side project illustrated how data science can make complex real-life data easier to understand.

It also gave me an insight into how I can manage my monthly outgoings more efficiently going forward.<br><br> My first  venture into Python and data analysis was now complete!

                            With the demands of pharmaceutical companies for novel reaction discovery and efficient routes to active bioactive molecules, High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) is becoming an increasingly useful tool to meet these demands. In HTE, many reactions are performed in parallel resulting in an array of data in a short space of time. <br><br>
                            This article provides an insight into the most common reaction types screened by the major pharmaceutical companies using HTE as well as several case-studies showcasing the success of this method in industry. <br><br>
                            Intriguingly, biocatalysis is the most common reaction type screened with transformations including transaminases and hydrolases. Considering chemical transformations, metal-catalysed coupling reactions are prevalent. Suzuki-Miyaura reactions are at the top of the board followed by Buchwald-Hartwig aminations. <br><br>
                            Also, there is a significant difference in the uptake of Pd-catalysed or Cu-catalysed coupling reactions within HTE programmes at different companies. Presumably, cost, ease of metal removal and environmental concerns are some of the factors involved in favouring one transition metal over another. <br><br>   
                            Staying on the theme of transition metal catalysed reactions, the article highlights the absence of Pd-catalysed C–H activation reactions in HTE – currently a hot-topic in academia.  However, it is suggested that in the next 3-5 years, this will be one of the most frequently employed transformations in HTE. <br><br>
                            In summary, HTE in the pharmaceutical industry continues to be a worthwhile investment with the benefits continuing to grow. Improvements to the speed of data generation and rapid interpretation of results has made this an important tool in the pharmaceutical tool-box.<br><br>

                            Utilising a tertiary alkylamine motif to couple an arene substrate via a metal-catalysed δ-C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H activation protocol has been an unresolved problem until now. <br><br>
                            For many existing metal-catalysed functionalisation reactions, a tailored functional group is required to position the metal at the correct location of a specific C–H bond. However, the use of these functional groups, termed Directing Groups (DGs) require overall longer synthetic routes due to installing and removing them from the molecule of interest. Many existing DGs also require harsh conditions to remove.<br><br>  
                            In this article, the above drawbacks of using traditional DGs is avoided by the use of a native functional group, a tertiary amine already present in the molecule.  <br><br>
                            However, using an alkylamine could lead to unwanted β-hydride elimination to occur on the alkyl backbone. Gaunt and co-workers avoided this deleterious pathway by employing a mono-protected amino acid. It was rationalised that this ligand favoured the C–H activation pathway by distorting the co-planar geometry necessary for β-hydride elimination.<br><br>
                            Considering the substrate scope, a range of (hetero)aryl boronic acids could be used as the coupling partner. The scope of the amine component was also very broad with several tertiary amines tolerated including both acyclic and cyclic scaffolds. An example of this transformation is shown below. </p>

                            Moreover, this protocol was successfully applied to the late-stage functionalisation of bioactive compounds. Impressively, an enantioselective transformation was also developed with up to 90% e.e.  <br><br>
                            In summary, a C–H arylation protocol using tertiary alkylamines has been developed. This method has the potential for modifiying tertiary alkylamine containing pharmaceutical compounds, of which there exists plenty. As a result, novel bioactive chemical space can be explored with little chemical effort. <br><br>

                            The use of covalently attached DGs for selective C–H functionalisation has been extensively explored but there exist limitations to this methodology including the need of longer synthetic routes. However, a non-covalent temporary DG (TDG) could deliver the same site selectivity in less synthetic steps. <br><br>
                            Maiti and co-workers have pioneered a novel TDG that achieves this. The TDG binds to the substrate reversibly and coordinates to a metal centre, bringing the metal near to the desired C–H bond. While several DG motifs were examined including nitriles and quinolines, it was found that pyrimidine-based templates were the most promising. An example of this transformation is shown below. </p>

                            When performing reaction optimisation, the article comments that the commonly used solvent for C–H activation, HFIP had to be discarded as it can lead to imine decomposition. However, the solvent DCE could be substituted for HFIP while retaining good yields. From a health perspective, DCE should best be avoided due to its acute toxicity. <br><br>
                            Analysing the scope of this olefination protocol, a diverse range of coupling partners was possible including short-chain and long-chain olefins. Natural products appended with acrylates including testosterone derivatives were well-tolerated signifying the potential use of this procedure in a pharmaceutical setting. For the corresponding aromatic substrate, electron neutral, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing aryl systems could all be olefinated at the <i>meta</i> position with good regioselectivity. <br><br>
                            In summary, a temporary DG was developed that can achieve <i>meta</i>-C–H olefination without the need to install or remove a DG in two separate steps. This protocol has the potential for pyrimidine-based TDGs to be used for other C–H functionalisations such as allylation and alkynylation transformations. <br><br>
